h1. Contest

Run a contest to select a random person who follows you on Twitter.

h2. Prerequisites

Two excellent gems:

    sudo gem install adamwiggins-rest-client
    sudo gem install nokogiri

* "REST Client":http://github.com/adamwiggins/rest-client
* "Nokogiri":http://github.com/tenderlove/nokogiri

h2. Instructions

Clone the repo:

    git clone git://github.com/thoughtbot/contest.git

Create a ~/.twitter/credentials.yml file. This file contains your Twitter credentials. For example:

    name: thoughtbot

Run the program:

    rake contest

The output will be:

    authenticating, caching followers... (this may take a moment)
    and the winner is... grossberg
